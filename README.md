<h2>MPY or mappy is a way to extract value from a map, inspired from mxj gitub.com/clbanning/mxj</h2>

<h3>The goal of this is to have additional feautures like retrieving structures from getValueFromPath with getStructFromPath,
or get multiple values from getStructsFromPath, with more features to come</h3>

<h4>If someone wants to redo this please and thank you!</h4>
